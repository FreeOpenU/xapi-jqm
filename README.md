xapi-jqm
========

Integration of the Experience API (xAPI) using jQuery Mobile (jQM) with demos and templates based on xapi-jqm which handle the heavy lifting in communicating statements to a Learning Record Store (LRS).

Instructional designers and developers can focus on content and HTML rather than writing javasript code, without limiting their abilities to extend their statements and tracking of interactions.
